The wallets are a crucial part of interacting with our network, we have several wallet repos

- [dusk-wallet-js](https://github.com/dusk-network/dusk-wallet-js)
    A javascript library that allows you to use a wallet on the web and node endpoints
- [dusk-wallet-core](https://github.com/dusk-network/wallet-core/)
    A web assembly/rust library that lets you write transactions for transfer, stake and do basic wallet utilities
- [wallet-cli](https://github.com/dusk-network/wallet-cli/)
    A cli wallet written in rust to interface with our network

There's specific guides on how to use the API of `wallet-core` and `dusk-wallet-js` but `web-wallet` and `wallet-cli`
are applications meant to be used as wallets. There will be more documentation regarding all the wallet repos so stay tuned
