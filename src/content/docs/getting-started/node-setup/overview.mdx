# Types of Nodes

Dusk supports several types of nodes, each serving a specific need within the ecosystem.

- **Full Nodes**: Combines the capabilities of a Provisioner node and Prover node. They maintain a complete copy of the blockchain, validate transactions and contribute to the network's consensus.
- **Provisioner Nodes**: Specialized in participating directly in consensus. Provisioner nodes are responsible for validating transactions and proposing new blocks. 
- **Prover Nodes**: Focused on creating Zero-Knowledge proofs. Prover nodes are essential for generating the proofs for private transactions.

# Setting Up a Node

There are multiple ways to set up a Dusk node. The pages below provide information and methods on how to run a node.
