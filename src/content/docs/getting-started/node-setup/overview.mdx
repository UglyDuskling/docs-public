## Types of Nodes

Dusk supports several types of node configurations, depending on the preference of the users and their intended setup. 

- **Provisioner**: Provisioners are specialized in directly participating in the consensus. They play a vital role as they are responsible for validating transactions, as well as processing and appending new blocks to Dusk blockchain.
- **Prover**: Provers carry on the computation-heavy task of creating Zero-Knowledge proofs (ZKP), which are a requirement for transactions on Dusk.
- **Full Node**: A full node combines the capabilities of a provisioner node and prover node. 
- **Archiver**: While Provisioners and full nodes generally only keep the current state of the blockchain, Archivers instead maintain a complete copy of the blockchain. They normally don't actively engage in consensus related tasks and do not require a valid Stake.

:::tip[Recommended Setup]
The recommended setup for network participants is to run a Provisioner node on a VPS or server, and a Prover locally on their machine/laptop. This ensures the most efficient configuration where the full resources of your machine is at disposal to the consensus, while maximizing privacy.

## Setting Up a Node

There are multiple ways to set up a Dusk node. The pages below provide information and methods on how to run a node.
