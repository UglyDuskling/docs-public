## What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a self-executing digital agreement whose terms and conditions are directly written into lines of code. Even if the concept of smart contracts has been <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html" target="_blank" >introduced in 1994</a>, it became more popular after the creation of general purpose blockchains. The reason is that storing smart contracts on a blockchain ensures transparency, security, and immutability.

Blockchain nodes validate each step of the contract's execution and ensure its correctness, therefore allowing users to trust the contract's execution without requiring a central authority. 

As smart contracts live on the blockchain, once deployed they cannot be modified. Anyways, for upgradability purposes, developers can take advantage of specific patterns (e.g. proxy contracts).


#### Methods
The logic of a smart contract is executed by the calling one of its methods. Methods can be called by users directly, or by other smart contracts. Methods can consume data and can branch their code based on its properties, and on other conditions such as the current state of the chain. Based on these conditions, the method may decide to continue execution of the contract's logic, or reject the execution entirely. The product of the execution depends on the coded logic, which can involve transferring funds, issuing digital assets, triggering other contracts, and much more...

Smart contracts can be designed to implement fallback methods when receiving cryptocurrencies so that when a user sends cryptocurrency to a smart contract's address, the contract can automatically execute predefined actions based on the received funds. 

#### State

Each smart contract has its own state, which is the persistent data maintained by the contract. This means that for every smart contract, there is a single, globally consistent state at any time, maintained across all nodes. In other words, the smart contract's state is a global singleton. 

Queries can access and return parts or the entirety of this state, while transactions are responsible for state mutations. 

State variables, mappings, arrays, and structs are part of the smart contract's state, and updating any of these implies a state transition. Each state transition is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring a permanent and immutable record of all changes.

The data held in state variables can be updated based on the logic defined in the contract. It is important to note that even if the state of a smart contract can change through transactions, the contract code itself is immutable once deployed (unless using a proxy contract).

##### Gas

Executing smart contracts involves computational work performed by the network nodes. The unit of measurement used to quantify the computational effort required for executing operations on a blockchain is called gas. Gas measures the amount of work needed to perform a task: the more complex the task, the more gas it requires. 

While gas itself measures computation, the gas price determines native cryptocurrency you are willing to pay per unit of gas. Gas pricing serves as a mechanism to prevent spam and misuse of the network. By requiring users to pay for the computational resources they consume, it discourages malicious actors from overloading the network with excessive or inefficient operation

Gas prices fluctuate based on network demand. When the network is congested, gas prices can spike, making transactions more expensive. Conversely, in periods where the network is less congested, gas price is lower. You can learn more on how gas works on Dusk by reading the [Gas Management](/learn/economic-information/gas-management) page.

## Considerations when writing Smart Contracts

#### Determine the necessary contracts

When developing smart contracts, it is important to understand which functionalities need to be implemented and to categorize them into distinct contracts based on their responsibilities.
This modular approach helps manage complexity and improve maintainability. It is recomended to clearly outline how these contracts will interact, documenting data flows and the function calls across different contracts.

As an example, depending on the complexity of your contract, it may make sense to split it into 3 contracts: 

- A *business logic* contract, where the main logic of your contract lives. Isolating business logic in a specific contract that contains the core functionality allows the logic contract to be updated independently of the contract data.
- A *data-handling* contract, so that all critical data is stored in a dedicated contract, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- A *proxy* contract, to manage the contract version and point to the right contract depending on the block height

Implement a mechanism to update the proxyâ€™s reference to new logic contracts without changing the proxy address, ensuring continuity for users and other interacting contracts.

#### Minimize trust assumptions

It is important to design contracts to minimize the need for trust, as well as indentify and eliminate single points of failure. A safe approach is assuming that stakeholders might act maliciously and ensure the contract logic accounts for such scenarios.


#### Audits
It is important to conduct in-depth code reviews and have third-party audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities. This is especially important for smart contracts, as hacks or bugs can have devastating consequences.

#### Gas consumption and optimization

It is important to write efficient code especially to minimize gas consumption. As smart contracts consume gas while performing their execution, it is key to avoid unnecessary computations, and store data efficiently. Where feasible, it is convenient to batch multiple operations into a single transaction to save gas.
