Developers can gather insights from the <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/piecrust/tree/main/contracts" target="_blank" >contracts examples</a>, and look at their <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/piecrust/tree/main/piecrust/tests" target="_blank" >tests</a>.

When going through the examples, developers will notice some patterns:

- There is a specific semantic presence of specific [semantics](/getting-started/vm/01-sc-on-dusk/09-semantics)
- The use of [sessions](/getting-started/vm/01-sc-on-dusk/07-sessions)
- Constants ```OWNER``` and ```LIMIT``` are used to standardize the owner and execution limit.


# Where to start

The first example to look at is the [counter example](/getting-started/vm/03-examples/01-counter-example)
