title: Examples
---

Developers can gather insights from the <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/piecrust/tree/main/contracts" target="_blank">contract examples</a>, and look at their corresponding <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/piecrust/tree/main/piecrust/tests" target="_blank">tests</a>.

When going through the examples, developers will notice some patterns:
- There is a distinct set of semantics defined for [smart contracts on Dusk](/getting-started/vm/01-sc-on-dusk/09-semantics)
- The use of [sessions](/getting-started/vm/01-sc-on-dusk/07-sessions)
- The constants `OWNER` and `LIMIT` are used to standardize the owner (deployer) and execution limit

# Where to start

The first example to look at is the [counter example](/getting-started/vm/03-examples/01-counter-example)
