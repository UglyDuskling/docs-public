Circuits
There are 4 circuits that are currently available, each for different permutations of number of input notes, up to a max of 4, which is the maximum number that a user can spend/transfer at once. Nothing stops a user from aggregating these notes by transferring them to himself, which is basically what the wallet does (it aggregates the userâ€™s notes).
