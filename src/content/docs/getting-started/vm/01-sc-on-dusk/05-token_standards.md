# What is a Token Standard?
Token Standards are predefined sets of rules and guidelines that define how tokens on a blockchain should behave and interact. These standards ensure interoperability, consistency, and functionalities across applications. 

A Token Standard specifies the parameters and data types that must be used in the functions associated with the token contract, ensuring that the format for inputs and outputs for each smart contract function are well defined. A Token Standard lists the necessary functions that a token must implement, ensuring that any application that is interoperable with the standard is able to interact with the token without the need any additional code. Adhering to a standard involves implementing the exact same contract functions, which accept the same inputs and produce the same outputs.
