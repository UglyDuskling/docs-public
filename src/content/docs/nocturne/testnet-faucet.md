title: Dusk Testnet Faucet 
description: "This guide will explain how to obtain nDUSK in the running Dusk Testnet."
---

The Dusk testnet uses a Discord bot to distribute Testnet tokens, as the old Twitter/X page has been deprecated.

In order to access it, follow these steps:

1. Access the [Dusk Discord server](https://discord.gg/dusknetwork).
2. Among the team members, locate the bot "Dusk Testnet Faucet."
3. Right-click and select "Message."
4. Send `!dusk` as a command. The bot will reply, asking for your Testnet wallet address. 
5. Done! Your transaction will be queued, and you will see it in your wallet once processed.

There is currently a limit of 1 transaction per user/wallet every 24 hours.


## FAQs

Q: How many times can I use the faucet?  
A: There is currently a 24-hour cooldown period before you can ask for tDUSK again with the same Discord username or wallet address.

Q: How do I access the Dusk Discord server?  
A: You can access the Discord server by clicking on [this link](https://discord.gg/dusknetwork).

Q: How long before I will see my tDUSK?  
A: Once the transaction is submitted, it will be processed in a queue. 
The time required to see the tDUSK in your account may vary according to network congestion and the number of people currently requesting tDUSK, but it usually takes just a few minutes. 
If the network is experiencing a large number of faucet requests, the transaction might take longer than usual to be processed.

Q: What if I want to run multiple nodes?  
A: If you need tDUSK for multiple accounts, you can either wait 24 hours and then send again to the other wallet, or send your tDUSK to the first wallet, and then transfer some of it to the second wallet yourself.

Q: I got error X, what should I do?  
A: If you encounter an error with the Discord faucet, please get in touch in our Telegram or Discord channel.

Q: But I liked the old Twitter Faucet!  
A: While the old Twitter/X faucet worked well for us during average traffic times, the exceptional response we received from the ITN made it unusable due to Twitter's limitations on API rate requests per minute.
