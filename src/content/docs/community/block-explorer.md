Transactions data can be seen on the [Dusk Block Explorer](https://explorer.dusk.network/), as well as statistics and information regarding the network.

As Dusk is a privacy-focused blockchain, transactions data does not include amounts or addresses (e.g. recipient or sender).Anyways, the block explorer can be used to see which types of transactions are submitted, as well as their transaction fee and gas used.
