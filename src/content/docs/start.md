# User Documentation

Welcome! Here we will explain you what Dusk is, its components, and how it works.

##  What is Dusk

Welcome to the Dusk documentation. Dusk is the first global computer with **privacy-preserving dApps** built for **real world adoption** and assets (RWA). Dusk protocol has been built from the ground up for financial applications and services, providing a secure, private, and scalable infrastructure for the digital economy. Dusk ultimate goal is to enable a full and decentralized **Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI)** powering clearance & settlement, post-trading services, and corporate actions for securities and digital assets.

## Overview

Dusk is designed to power the next generation of financial applications by offering a privacy-centric, decentralized platform. Our protocol addresses key challenges in the financial sector, such as privacy, compliance, and scalability, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of financial services.

### Key Features

#### Privacy
- Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (PlonK and Poseidon) to ensure transaction privacy.
- Phoenix transaction model provides a balance between privacy and regulatory compliance.

#### Scalability
- Kadcast networking protocol enhances scalability and network efficiency.
- Succinct Attestation consensus mechanism ensures fast and secure transactions.

#### Compliance
- Citadel protocol manages digital identities, crucial for KYC/AML compliance.
- Zedger protocol encodes Mifid II regulation directly into the transaction model.
- Smart contracts and dApps can be programmed to automatically adhere to regulatory requirements.

#### Developer And User Friendly
- Piecrust VM facilitates the development of complex, privacy-focused dApps.
- Smart Contracts can be written in rust as well as any programming language that targets WebAssembly (WASM) bytecode.

#### Financially Sound
- The Economic Protocol allows service providers to be productized and profit, keeps developers incentivized, and unlocks completely new breed of use cases.

## Use Cases

Dusk is suited for a variety of financial applications, including:

- Asset Tokenization
- Clearance & Settlement Of Securitized Assets
- Decentralized Exchanges
- Privacy-Focused Financial Services
- Compliance Automation
