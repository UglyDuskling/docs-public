The **Smart Contracts** section guides you through the different aspects of smart contract development on Dusk.

## What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a self-executing digital agreement whose terms and conditions are directly written into lines of code. Even if the concept of smart contracts has been <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html" target="_blank">introduced in 1994</a>, it became more popular after the creation of general purpose blockchains. The reason is that storing smart contracts on a blockchain ensures transparency, security, and immutability.

## Smart contracts on Dusk

### Overview

Smart Contracts are a key feature of Dusk, playing a fundamental role at the protocol level. Specifically, both transferring the native currency and staking functionalities are implemented as <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk/tree/master/contracts" target="_blank">genesis contracts</a>.

Dusk offers robust support for smart contracts, as developers can leverage the features offered by <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/piecrust" target="_blank">Piecrust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/piecrust/blob/main/piecrust-uplink/README.md" target="_blank">piecrust-uplink</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk" target="_blank">Rusk</a>.

In order to deploy a smart contract, developers only need to compile their contracts to WASM. This is possible because the <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/piecrust" target="_blank">Piecrust</a> VM manages the contract’s bytecode, state, and runtime sandboxed environment.

Even though developers can use any programming language that compiles to WASM (e.g. C, C++, Go...), we recommend Rust for writing smart contracts due to its security benefits and integration in our ecosystem.

### Methods

The logic of a smart contract is executed by calling one of its methods. Methods can be called by users directly, or by other smart contracts. Methods can consume data and can branch their code based on its properties, and on other conditions such as the current state of the chain.
Based on these conditions, the method may decide to continue execution of the contract's logic, or reject the execution entirely. 

The product of the execution depends on the coded logic, which can involve transferring funds, issuing digital assets, triggering other contracts, etc.

Smart contracts can be programmed to execute specific code when receiving cryptocurrencies. This means that when a user sends cryptocurrency to a smart contract's address, the contract can automatically perform predefined actions based on the received funds.

Smart contracts on the Dusk blockchain employ two types of methods: 
- **Queries**: designed to retrieve data without altering the contract’s state.
- **Transactions**: designed to modify the contract’s state but do not return data. 

This distinction is crucial for understanding how smart contracts interact with the Dusk blockchain.

Understanding the mechanism of argument passing to and from queries and transactions is beneficial, as each contract has a memory area for argument passing, and host methods simplify this process by handling the details. Utilizing host-provided methods can result in significant computational power savings, especially for intensive functions like cryptographic has functions and zero-knowledge proof verification.

### Events

Smart contracts on Dusk can use events as a lightweight mechanism to provide feedback, and they are particularly useful for triggering actions on the caller's side.

Events serve as a logging mechanism that facilitates interactions between various applications and can be emitted by either queries or transactions. Events can be processed post-call by the caller, which can then execute its logic accordingly

Clients can subscribe to events emitted by smart contract execution, transactions and blocks by using the <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk/wiki/RUES-(Rusk-Universal-Event-System)" target="_blank">Rusk Universal Event System</a>.
