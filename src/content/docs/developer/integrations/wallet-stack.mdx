The wallet is a crucial part of interacting with our network. We have the wallet repositories that follow.

- [dusk-wallet-core](https://github.com/dusk-network/wallet-core/)
    A web assembly/rust library that allows you to write transactions for transfer, stake and do basic wallet actions.
- [rusk-wallet](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk/tree/master/rusk-wallet/)
    A CLI wallet written in rust to interface with our network.

There's a specific guide on how to use the API of `wallet-core`, but `rusk-wallet`
is an application meant to be used as a standalone wallet.
