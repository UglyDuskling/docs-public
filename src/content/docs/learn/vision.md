# Dusk

> ðŸ”® *The power of DeFi, the privacy of Fintech institutions, the control of FMIs - at the fingertip of all users*

Dusk is an open source and secure network infrastructure which hosts a privacy-preserving distributed ledger technology - or `DLT` - conceived for the digitization - or `tokenization` - of all types of financial instruments, as well as for clearance & settlement operations of their transactions.

Dusk is powered by cutting-edge technology, engineered for the inception and deployment of disintermediated services and decentralized applications with a specific focus on the financial sector, both traditional or alternative.

## Mission

With **Mission** we define Dusk organizationâ€™s *core purpose, focus, and aims*. A declaration of what should drive each and every strategic and tactical decision, and stay consistent throughout our entire journey. We aim for each member of our organization to keep in mind at all time the mission of Dusk protocol.

:::tip[Dusk Mission]
**We empower users to fully control their assets**
:::

This mission statement is short but dense in its significance. In its essence, Dusk enroots within the `decentralized finance` (or `DeFi`) movement, insofar as aiming to return to the users the prerogative to be custodians of their own assets, and dispose of them as they see fit (within the confines of what the law allows). 

In fact, the ambition goes far beyond custodianship, as `DeFi` protocols provide the opportunity to augment digital assets with behaviours and characteristics that can be directly programmed within the assets themselves, and composed as the users sees fit. These behaviours are codified within the so called `smart contracts`.

> ðŸ’¡ `DeFi` protocols uniquely allow for **user-centric composability of applications**, as well as **global liquidity aggregation** across the entirety of their ecosystem. This departs radically from the incumbent **platform-brokered** landscape, where financial services are siloed, interoperability is almost non-existent, and liquidity is fragmented.

## Vision

While the mission highlights our primary purpose, Dusk's **Vision** describes the desired state of our organization within a foreseeable timeframe and guides the direction of the business's efforts in a practical way. You can regard it as the objective of the organization and the lighthouse in planning and constantly reassessing the step in building a highly-effective strategic plan.

:::tip[Dusk Vision] 
**Vision - We envision a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into the global economy through a decentralized financial market infrastructure.**
:::

It is worth expanding on some of the terminology of our *Vision Statement* and their significance for Dusk's overall strategy in advancing our [Mission](#mission).

Dusk's Vision significantly extends the `DeFi` focus horizon. The latter relates almost exclusively to a class of digital assets (i.e. `Utility Tokens`) alternative to, and non-overlapping with traditional asset-backed instruments. Instead, our Vision extends the *DeFi principles* to the whole panoply of assets and, as such, it encompasses the entire ensemble of digital tokens, including those being **asset-backed**, i.e. **tokens representing ownership of real world goods or financial instruments, and as such regulated by the law**. The most emblematic of these assets are [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp), and with `Security Tokens` we indicate their digital representation on the `DLT` (i.e. *Digital Ledger Technology* such as *Blockchain*).

:::note
ðŸ”® We indicate with the term `RegDeFi` the extension of `DeFi` protocols to include tokens representing or digitizing regulated financial assets on DLT. RegDeFi applications provide the necessary regulatory compliance to extend DeFi to regulated assets such as bonds, stocks, ETFs, etc.

## Ambition

The [DLT-R regime](https://www.ey.com/en_gr/tax/tax-alerts/regulation-eu-2022-858-on-distributed-ledger-technology-market-infrastructures) came into effect in June 2023. It is Dusk ambition to comply with the DLT-R regulation and enhance a licensed security exchange to operate under such exemption.

## Culture

At Dusk, we prioritize our core values of integrity, communication, innovation, responsibility, and collaboration in all of our endeavors. 

We are a flat, community-oriented organization that is focused on advancing a novel networking protocol through a combination of pervasive knowledge sharing, an evolutionary development process, frequent communication, and joint ownership of all deliverables. We strive to tame complexity through these practices and to be a trusted and respected leader in the decentralized software industry.

We are committed to honesty, effective communication, and continuous innovation, and we take ownership of our tasks and responsibilities with a focus on excellence and the best interests of our users. We also value collaboration and teamwork, fostering a culture of mutual support and shared knowledge.

These values are integral to our identity as a company and our commitment to delivering high-quality decentralized software.

Every core team member pledges to abide to the highest moral standard codified by the [core values](/core-values) of the organization.

# Use Cases

Dusk Network is ideal for building transactional applications with high throughput and privacy, that achieve immediate finality without relying on centralized infrastructure or trusted third parties. Organizations have been successfully building applications in different contexts on top of our technology, for example: 

- Automated and self-governing securities.
- Confidential smart contracts and security tokens.
- Digital share registry management.
- Decentralized smart bulletin boards.
- Proxy voting
- Self-custodial applications.
- Decentralized Finance.

## A Note On Privacy And Compliance

Dusk Network uniquely offers the possibility to automate processes previously requiring the aid of trusted (and costly) third parties. The novel use of [Zero-Knowledge technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) enables organizations to harness the power of DLT while respecting confidentiality agreements, and data protection legislation. Anyone can leverage Dusk Network to inexpensively issue *programmable* financial assets that are governed by privacy preserving smart contracts.

The privacy aspect of Dusk allows to overcome issues associated with the use of open ledgers, where transactions are broadcasted publicly among users in clear. Some of these problems include market manipulation from the transaction validators (i.e. the so called [MEV](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/)), the impossibility to [comply to GDPR](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2019/634445/EPRS_STU(2019)634445_EN.pdf) especially when KYC/AML procedures are involved, the perils associated to the lack of privacy ranging from financial risks to social engineering, hacking, and threats to personal freedom.
