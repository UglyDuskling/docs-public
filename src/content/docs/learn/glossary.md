## Definitions

#### Account

With respect to a blockchain that employs an account-based model, the combination of a private key and a public key whereby funds of one or more persons are stored as balance.

#### Account-Based Transaction Model

An accounting scheme that represents assets as balances within personal accounts, similar to bank accounts.

#### Application Program Interface (API)

Software code that enables communication between independent systems, such as computer programs and applications, in the form of a request-response message. For example, price aggregators submit order size, order time, and token address through the APIs of airlines’ cryptocurrency exchanges and receive prices for coins meeting those specifications in response.

#### Asset Token

A category of tokens that represent a “real world” asset or product — such as a commodity (e.g., gold) or currency (e.g., US dollar) — as opposed to utility tokens, which provide the holder with access to or the ability to do something on the network.

#### Balance

With respect to an account-based transaction model, the assets which a person owns and thus can exchange and spend.

#### Bandwidth

The maximum amount of data that can be transmitted across a path in a fixed period of time.

#### BLS Digital Signature

A digital signature that uses elliptic curves to encrypt the public key and private key of the parties involved in order to permit people to sign transactions on the blockchain without revealing any data.

#### Block

Files in which data of the network is permanently recorded. A block permanently stores records of transactions which, once written, cannot be altered or removed. Every time a block is completed, a new block is formed in the blockchain.

#### Block Explorer

A web-based tool that allows an individual to search for information on the blockchain (e.g., the creation date and size of a block, or the transactions and corresponding addresses contained within such a block).

#### Block Header

Metadata included in every block that provides a summary of the data in the block (e.g., the hash of the previous block, the block height, a time stamp, or the nonce of the block)

#### Block Height

With respect to a block, the number of blocks preceding the block in question — i.e., the number of blocks between that block and the genesis block (which always has a block height of zero).

#### Block Generator

A provisioner elected by the network to produce a new block in exchange for a reward in $DUSK.

#### Block Reward

An amount of tokens awarded by the network to eligible stakers for each block they create successfully.

#### Block Time

#### Brute Force Attack (BFA)

An attack method in which hackers attempt to crack a private key via multiple guess attempts until one works.

#### Confidential Smart Contract

A smart contract which permits the creation of confidential or private transactions.

#### Confirmation

The verification of blocks on the blockchain by stakers. When a block has been verified, it is accepted and added to the blockchain.

#### Consensus

A process to achieve agreement by the majority of peers within the network. Achieving consensus means the group of peers have agreed on the state of the blockchain.

#### Cryptographic Hash Function

A special class of hash function that has certain properties in order to make it secure and ideal for cryptographic purposes, including the following: (i) it is deterministic, meaning it always produces the same result; (ii) it is fast, meaning it returns the hash of an input very quickly; (iii) it is pre-image resistant, meaning it is virtually impossible to determine the original input data from its hash value; and (iv) even a small change in the input data would result in a massive change to the hash value.

#### Decentralized

When the functions and power of an activity or organization are dispersed and Peer to Peer, rather than concentrated in a central location or authority.

#### Decentralized Application

A digital program that runs on a P2P or decentralized network and uses smart contracts to access the blockchain and enforce each term of agreement between two parties.

#### Devnet

A network used as an experimental environment by blockchain users, token holders, app developers, and network validators and where tokens have no monetary value.

#### Digital Signature

A tool used to sign transactions on the blockchain that verifies the identity of the signer or sender. Each signer uses a private key to produce a unique ‘digital signature’ that can only be decrypted by the signer’s public key — which the signer shares with the receiver.

#### Double Spend (Attack)
